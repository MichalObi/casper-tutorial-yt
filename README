Project Description

This repository contains two projects based on the official Casper Lab tutorial, also known as the Casper Association dApp Developer Series on YouTube.

To work with these projects, both Rust and Node need to be installed.

Also you need CSPR tokens in your account to make propper smart contract deploy. 

Project 1: My Project

My Project requires the cargo-casper crate to work properly and build the smart contract. Most of the template files are generated by cargo casper my-project. To compile the contract, we use make prepare and make build-contract. The contract contains a message field that can be set, updated, and queried via the index.js Node script. The contract must first be deployed to the Casper network testnet. An extended version of the app is placed in the casper-interface folder.

Project 2: NFT Test Script

The NFT test script is based on the CEP-78 Casper format that allows for the creation of NFTs by defining a set of fields defined in the cep-78-enhanced-nft folder that contains the smart contract.
